## Installation & Setup

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:
1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kritin04/Event-Booking-System
    cd event-booking-system
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask psycopg2-binary
    ```
4.  **Database Setup (PostgreSQL):**
      * **Install PostgreSQL:** If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, download and install it from [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

      * **Create a Database:** Create a new database for this project (e.g., `event_db`).

      * **Create Tables:** You will need to create the `Users`, `Event`, and `Tickets` tables. Here's a conceptual schema you can adapt:

        ```sql
        -- Users Table
        CREATE TABLE Users (
            UID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            Fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            Lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            State VARCHAR(50),
            City VARCHAR(50),
            DOB DATE,
            Ref_UID INT, -- For referral, if applicable
            -- Add columns for username/email and password_hash for authentication
            Username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            Password_Hash TEXT NOT NULL
        );

        -- Event Table
        CREATE TABLE Event (
            EventID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            EventName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            EventDate DATE NOT NULL,
            EventTime TIME,
            Location VARCHAR(255),
            Description TEXT,
            Capacity INT NOT NULL,
            TicketsAvailable INT NOT NULL
        );

        -- Tickets Table
        CREATE TABLE Tickets (
            TicketID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            UID INT NOT NULL,
            EventID INT NOT NULL,
            SeatNo VARCHAR(50), -- Or INT depending on your seat numbering
            TPrice DECIMAL(10, 2),
            BookingDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            FOREIGN KEY (UID) REFERENCES Users(UID),
            FOREIGN KEY (EventID) REFERENCES Event(EventID)
        );
        ```

      * **Configure `db_config.py`:** Create a file named `db_config.py` in the root directory of your project (same level as `app.py`) with your PostgreSQL connection details:

        ```python
        import psycopg2

        def get_db_connection():
            conn = psycopg2.connect(
                host="localhost",          # Your PostgreSQL host
                database="event_db",       # Your database name
                user="your_db_user",       # Your database username
                password="your_db_password" # Your database password
            )
            return conn
        ```

        *(**Important:** Replace `event_db`, `your_db_user`, and `your_db_password` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.)*

5.  **Create `templates` Directory:**

      * Create a folder named `templates` in the same directory as `app.py`.
      * Inside `templates`, you will need `index.html`, `add_user.html`, `events.html`, and `book_ticket.html`. (The content for these HTML files is not provided in your `app.py` but is essential for the app to run).

-----

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, run the Flask application from your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will launch, and you can access it in your web browser, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Important Notes

  * **Secret Key:** Remember to change `"your_secret_key"` in `app.py` to a strong, random string for production environments.
  * **Password Hashing:** The provided `app.py` does not include password hashing for user registration/login. For a production-ready application, you **must** implement secure password hashing (e.g., using `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash` and `check_password_hash`).
  * **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling for database operations and user inputs.
  * **Frontend Files:** The HTML template files (`.html`) are crucial for the application's functionality but are not included in the provided Python code. You will need to create these.

-----

## Future Enhancements

  * **User Registration & Login:** Implement full user registration with password hashing and robust login validation.
  * **Event Creation/Management (Admin Panel):** Develop an administrative interface for event organizers to add, edit, and delete events, and manage ticket capacities.
  * **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate a secure payment gateway for paid events.
  * **Email Notifications:** Send automated email confirmations and reminders to users upon booking.
  * **Search and Filter Logic:** Implement the backend logic for searching and filtering events based on various criteria (e.g., date, category, location).
  * **Ticket Cancellation/Refunds:** Add functionality for users to manage their bookings, including cancellations.
  * **Enhanced UI/UX:** Further refine the frontend design and user experience.
